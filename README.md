**Product List App:**

This is an iOS application built using Swift and UIKit, follows MVVM + Clean architecture. The app fetches a list of categories and allows the user to view detailed products information in  each category.

Includes MVVM design pattern, dependency injection, Combine and Unit test cases.

**To run the project, ensure you have:**
macOS with the latest Xcode
Swift 5.5+
iOS 16+ Simulator (or physical device)

**Layers and responsibilities**
The project is organized into distinct layers, each responsible for specific concerns:

Models: Domain models for products data
Views: views responsible for the UI layout and presentation.
ViewModels: Contains view models that manage UI state and interact with the domain layer.
Domain: Business logic and repositories.
